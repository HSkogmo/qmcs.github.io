Who are you and what are you doing?
===================================

We are James and Uche. Together we founded Yapnak_; the lunch app that brings
students exclusive lunch deals for Â£5 and no hassle. Funnily enough, we're not
tech guys (background wise) but instead both final year `Queen Mary medical
students <http://www.smd.qmul.ac.uk/>`_. However, we love food and so Yapnak was
born. When we're not being student doctors we're working on Yapnak and trying to
create the best possible food service that students can have. With over 500
downloads and 100 claims in a few weeks we're actively trying to fan the flame.
We've managed to getsign up some of the trendier restaurants around like
Tayyabs, Greedy Cow and even our very own Drapers! If you haven't heard of us or
seen the app check it out via our web link www.yapnak.com.

What do you expect from a recent graduate to become a successful member of your team?
=====================================================================================

That's a good question. Three things spring to mind. Creativity, an infectious
personality, and a strong work ethic. At this stage we're looking for people who
can buy in to the ambition of our group, but don't need much motivation to get
going. It's always nice to have someone who can bring something a little
different to the team; of course that can vary from person to person.

How did you learn programming?
==============================

The simple answer to that question is we didn't! We have surrounded ourselves
with the right people and looked for those with skills that complement us. Enter
our CTO, Joshua. We needed a smart and personable tech person on the team and
when we identified him we brought him on board.
